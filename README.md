I only release on curseforge under the pseudonym WishiiFishii.

You can do whatever you want with this repo and the resulting mod except sell it. Advertising as a result of hosting this is OK. Beyond these two, the BSD (do *almost* anything) license stands.

Fork it, update it, learn from it, build on it, etc. I'm all for the minecraft modding community.
